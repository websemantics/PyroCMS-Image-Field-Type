# PyroCMS Image Field Type 2.0.0.

This is an in-development image field type to replace the current image field type in PyroCMS.

It adds the ability to upload an image immediately, without having to wait for a form submit.

To install, just replace the contents of `system/cms/modules/streams_core/field_types/image/` with the contents of this repository.

When this is a stable release, it will replace the current native image field type in PyroCMS on the next release.
